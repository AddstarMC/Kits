# Contributing

If you want to contribute to the development of Kits, be sure to familiarize yourself with these guidelines. Ensure that any changes you make fit the goals of Kits.

## Quick guide

1. Fork the repository.
- Make your changes in a new branch.
- Test your changes. Ensure they work as intended.
- Push your fork and submit a pull request.

## Coding convention

Ensure that you follow the appropriate coding conventions used throughout the code in Kits:

1. When indenting your code, make sure you do not use tabs. Use 4 spaces. This default behaviour can be changed in your IDE.
- Always use braces, even if your if statement has one execution statement.
- Use spaces between your method declaration and the first brace: `public void someMethod() {`
- Try to avoid nested if statements where they can be avoided.

## Notes

If you are changing existing code, be sure to comment what you changed and how it is an improvement over the existing code.
A bad example of contributing is adding something completely unnecessary, or adding something which would not suit the needs of every user who uses Kits.
Your pull request will be denied if you do this.
