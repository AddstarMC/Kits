Kits
====

Kits is a simple yet deceptively powerful plugin allowing you to create, edit and spawn custom kits in-game. When creating and editing a kit, you are provided an inventory in which you will be able to place any item into; changes are made when this inventory is closed.

If you want to contribute to the development of Kits, fork the repository and commit new changes. Don't forget to submit a pull request.
